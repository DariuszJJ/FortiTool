This script automates the generation of a Fortigate configuration file for managing LDAP users with FortiToken two-factor authentication. It serves two main purposes:

    Create Local LDAP User Entries:
        For each user listed in the CSV file, the script generates a config user local section in the configuration.
        It assigns the LDAP type, FortiToken for two-factor authentication, user email for notifications, and the LDAP server.

    Add Users to a Group:
        All users from the CSV file are added to a specific Fortigate group in the config user group section.
        This simplifies assigning collective access policies, such as SSL VPN access, for the group.

Use Case

The script is ideal for administrators managing multiple users who require two-factor authentication and group-based access control. It eliminates manual configuration by generating a ready-to-use CLI script from a simple CSV file.
